# training-go

In this repo I am keeping track of my progress solving the exercices from:

* [Medallia Internship Challenge 2019 exercises](http://www.medallia.com.ar/internships/doc/2019.pdf)

and

* [Grokking Algorithms](https://github.com/KevinOfNeu/ebooks/blob/master/Grokking%20Algorithms.pdf)



### DISCLAIMER
I am also using this to practise and keep learning Golang, so maybe don't take this code as source of trouth.
